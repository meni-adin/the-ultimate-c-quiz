After substituting the digraphs and trigraphs,
counting on type of everything is default to int (both function and arguments),
taking into account K&R function definition,
fixing the arguments names,
taking into account string-literal concatenation,
taking into account array subscript operator commutativity,
we'll get the following which is an equivalent program:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define macro(VAR) {VAR ? "\"" : "" } // not used in code

int // not required
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    if(argc)
        printf("%s\n", argv[0]);
}
#  // this is a null-directive, it does nothing
```
