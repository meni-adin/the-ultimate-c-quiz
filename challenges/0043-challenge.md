In C11 ยง6.10.8.1 the Standard says:

> The following macro names shall be defined by the implementation:<br>
...<br>
\_\_STDC\_\_ The integer constant 1, intended to indicate a conforming implementation.

Assuming you find your implementation defines it to 1 - what does it says about your implementation?
