The Standard specifies in at least 2 places (`C23`, `ยง6.6.11` footnote `133` and `ยง6.7.1.6` footnote `141`) that it's not a `null pointer constant`.

I'm not sure what is the distinction, as it may be used to initialize other pointers.

Maybe it's because it's still has to be casted to appropriate type.
